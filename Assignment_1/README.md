# Assignment 1
This assignment covers making a function in R, documenting it, and testing it. The md file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/functions-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/Assignment_1/assignment_1.md). 

In summary, I created a function for a plot that I used very often in the previous class (STAT545A): a combination of a box plot and a jitter plot that exlpores th distribution of a single numerical variable across different categorical variables, with the mean indicated in the plot and a nice aesthetic format. 

The output of this function is a ggplot object that can be further modified for the author's convenience.
