# STAT545B Assignments: functions
This is a repository created for the [STAT545B class](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca) at UBC. The main goal of this project is to create a function, document it and test it. It is divided in 4 stages, called assignments; each of them is intended to guide us through the steps of function making in R.

## Content
There are four folders in total, each of them containing the files its corresponding assignments, which contain mainly a .Rmd file that can be run in Rstudio, and a .md file, which is intended to be viewed here in github. 

- [Assignment 1](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/functions-ErickNavarroD/tree/main/Assignment_1): This assignment covers making a function in R, documenting it, and testing it. The md file can be viewed [here](https://github.com/stat545ubc-2021/functions-ErickNavarroD/blob/main/Assignment_1/assignment_1.md). In summary, I created a function for a plot that I used very often in the previous class (STAT545A): a combination of a box plot and a jitter plot that exlpores th distribution of a single numerical variable across different categorical variables, with the mean indicated in the plot and a nice aesthetic format. The outpot of this function is a ggplot object that can be further modified for the author's convenience.
